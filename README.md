## FlowWeb: Joint Image Set Alignment by Weaving Consistent, Pixel-wise Correspondences

This implements the joint image alignment algorithm described in our CVPR 2015 [paper](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/flowWeb/).

This is unsupported research code, with no warranty or claim of suitability for 
any particular purpose. However, feel free to contact me (tinghuiz at eecs dot berkeley dot edu) if you have any difficulty running the code or found a bug.

## Running the Code

Check out demo.m for how to run our joint alignment algorithm as well as the evaluation described in our CVPR paper.

## CVPR experiments
The PASCAL VOC data (images and annotations) used for producing results in Table 1 and 2 can be downloaded [here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/data/pascal_data.tar.gz). The original data are collected from the [PASCAL3D+](http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/pascal3d.html) as well as the [PASCAL-Part](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~xianjie.chen/pascal_part_dataset/pascal_part.html) datasets.

Our alignment results on the above PASCAL VOC data are available [here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/data/pascal_results.tar.gz).
