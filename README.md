## FlowWeb: Joint Image Set Alignment by Weaving Consistent, Pixel-wise Correspondences

This implements the joint image alignment algorithm described in our CVPR 2015 [paper](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/flowWeb/).

This is unsupported research code, with no warranty or claim of suitability for 
any particular purpose. However, feel free to contact me (tinghuiz at eecs dot berkeley dot edu) if you have any difficulty running the code or found a bug.

## Running the Code
